  IDEA: Some town/hero upgrades may require objectives on the map.
    For instance, most of fractions might not have direct access to
    the market, you would need to find market location on the map.
    But some fractions might access them without such requirements.

    It might also be applied to the development of the character.
    Some skills might be discovered after some locations on the
    map are visited.

  HERO: Satris.

  IDEA: Stats-based abilities. For instance, Veasin's poison
    might deal more damage per each point of attack.

    Or units might respond with damage = half of attack + half of
    defence * 1.

  IDEA: Some heroes might have special effects on their army to
    compensate some strong sides, for instance, hero might start
    with -10% fire resist.

    Some characters might have a passive ability that reduces
    the fire resistance of your army by 8%, then by 1% per each
    level, but also enemy's resistance by 4% per level, so
    starting from level 3 it becomes somewhat efficient.

  Fire-themed ideas:
    Firestorm: Deals 40 fire damage +20-40 additional damage,
      but also deals the lower bound of this damage to your random group.
      Base Manacost: 3

    Whip of Astral Fire: an item that might convert half of the damage
    from Firestorm to magical damage.

  Hellish creatures might have items that reduce or increase their
    Fire resists, like armor that gives +10%, but helm that
    reduces -15%.

  Fire creatures might have increased resists agains fire.

  Gates of Fire: A location that may consist of fire units (fire birds,
    fire elementals, etc.). Once defeated, some fire units will be
    suggested for hiring here (even if they weren't the part of guard).

  IDEA: there might be locations that consume mana in order
    to create units.
