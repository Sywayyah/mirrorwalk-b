/*
  Specialties can be more robust

  At the start, a player can pick one of suggested specialties:
    Mysticism, Rage Mastery, Economics, Necromancy, Tactics, some others

  When picking one, there will be an individual screen with some bonuses

  A specialty can be improved, starting with basic level, moving to advanced and expert.

  Player might also have some action card each week - by sacrificing 10 mana,
  he might be able to improve his specialties. Cost will grow every week by 4.
*/

/*
  Units can grant player additional powers.

  If player decided to play Fire build, he can also use Firebirds, Phoenixes, Fire Elementals

  their presence, with Specialty, can mutually increase the power of player and units
*/

/*
  Alongside cards that can affect player using his manacost - there can be different
  cards, for instance, for warrior class - at the cost of 5 mana, player's units
  gain +3 to Armor or +3 to Attack for the rest of the week - something of that kind.
*/

/*
  Game can become more interesting if factions are much more complicated than what they are now

  There can be many units of the same tier
  Many units can be developed in single building
  Many units of similar type can be produced in single faction
  Castle could produce both Firebirds and Phoenixes
  Phoenix would be a creature of higher tier with lots of abilities
  Higher tier creatures could possess properties like Giantism - makes 1-4 tier units do less

  Castle could allow for different schools of magic
  Learning an ability can cost max mana
  Stone Rain, Stone Wall


  Castle could allow for magical creatures of Stone and Ice
  Stone and Ice mages
  Titans and Ice Wyverns - high tier creatures produced there

/*
  Atlanta Temple
*/

/*
  Faction can have multiple units of same tier
*/

/*
  Garrison - populated randomly with units of your town or tavern
  units can be took for 1 day and will leave army next day.
*/

/*
  Special counterattacks - with a certain chance, a unit can deal increased retaliation damage

  Also can be accompanied with block

  And floating text can tell about improved version of counterattack

  I can concentrate more on content creation for the game, and some new ideas.
    1. Halberdiers can block damage based on their count (0.5/0.7 per Pikeman/Halberdier).
        giving some static percent makes it feel less important when units are being lost.
    2. Some hiring buildings can also have some other activities (sell items, spells, etc.)
        (same on the map, e.g. locations)
    3. Knights might gain 2 possible promotions: Paladins or some other type.
        - Knights could give Blessing and have their own manapool (maybe Blessing will go to hero).
            - side note - Knights can also give some Defencive ability, so some important units
              can be protected.
        - Paladins might have resistances and also grant Zeal (+1 turn in that round)
        - Other type can give 1 mana to all creatures and hero at the end of the round.
    4. Locations on the map: School of mixed arts. Also some places where player can gain
        new specialties, and increase the growth of units in his town (instant/weekly).
    5. Constellation: Sprites, Absorb Essence: Casted on target, allows other units to steal
        health on attacking target.

        -- Side Note: In theory, if there are different promotions to the same unit type,
            player might want to have both for greater effects.
    6. There can also me some ways to obtain magic (mb temporary, with books, etc.),
        so, heroes of Castle could obtain Fire Hydra ability.
        (for Constellation as well)

  Todo: When player opens info for something, there can be
  a side-line with arrow, that allows to close it.
*/

/*
  Todo: introduce some storng camp with strong rewards.

  IDEA: If there will be spells that might increase efficiency of certain
    units, it might also reduce efficiency of another units.

    For instance, if Hero is going to cast something that might make
    his undead units stronger, it might do something to other units,
    like: Undead units gain +5 speed, all other units loose 15% of speed.

  IDEA:
    Some locations on the map can be guarded by neutral enemy players.
    And these players might get power-ups over time.

  IDEAS: Necromancy? It could boost some abilities of the undead units
    It can increase damage reduction of Ghosts, Ghosts might
    reduce damage also for other undead units.
    Or it could be something like this: 30% reduction against Ghosts,
    15% reduction against other Undead, 9% reduction against all
    others.

    This can make a fun RPG element to have Necromancy. But, by the
    way. Character can actually find abilities in some locations. When
    player visits Night Tower, player can study +2 to Necromancy
    or get some undead mages or casters.

    Player can find some cards that will give bonuses to units.
    these bonuses can have their own sub-benefits after a certain level
    of some main specialty.

    Or could it be that... some abilities can be amplified by some
    special skill. Like, Undead units might get stronger when
    some spell is casted.

    There will also be Mixed Arts Schools or Witchcraft Schools
    that might offer, for instance, 3 options. Here player might
    find an option in case he doesn't see Night Tower on the map.

    This is also how skills and character can be upgraded, and
    this might make map more exciting and interesting to explore.

    It can also make players to play around things on the map.

    Sub-idea: Items/units that increase Necromancy?

  IDEA: UI. Considering that battlefield might get bigger with
    more units, maybe it makes sense to have RTS-like panels
    that will always stay visible, but battleground itself might
    become scrollable.

  IDEA: Event feed? There might be some visual event feed to help
    understand what happened over time (new day, gained resources
    from mines, units growth in the town).

  IDEA: Some town/hero upgrades may require objectives on the map.
    For instance, most of factions might not have direct access to
    the market, you would need to find market location on the map.
    But some factions might access them without such requirements.

    It might also be applied to the development of the character.
    Some skills might be discovered after some locations on the
    map are visited.

  HERO: Satris.

  IDEA: Stats-based abilities. For instance, Veasin's poison
    might deal more damage per each point of attack.

    Or units might respond with damage = half of attack + half of
    defence * 1.

  IDEA: Some heroes might have special effects on their army to
    compensate some strong sides, for instance, hero might start
    with -10% fire resist.

    Some characters might have a passive ability that reduces
    the fire resistance of your army by 8%, then by 1% per each
    level, but also enemy's resistance by 4% per level, so
    starting from level 3 it becomes somewhat efficient.

  Fire-themed ideas:
    Firestorm: Deals 40 fire damage +20-40 additional damage,
      but also deals the lower bound of this damage to your random group.
      Base Manacost: 3

    Whip of Astral Fire: an item that might convert half of the damage
    from Firestorm to magical damage.

  Hellish creatures might have items that reduce or increase their
    Fire resists, like armor that gives +10%, but helm that
    reduces -15%.

  Fire creatures might have increased resists agains fire.

  Gates of Fire: A location that may consist of fire units (fire birds,
    fire elementals, etc.). Once defeated, some fire units will be
    suggested for hiring here (even if they weren't the part of guard).

  IDEA: there might be locations that consume mana in order
    to create units.
