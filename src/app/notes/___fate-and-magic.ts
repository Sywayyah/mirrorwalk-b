  Heroes might be able to purchase magic in the town using Fate Points.
    Fate points can be granted as reward for something or visiting
    some locations (lake of lily pads).

    Abilities can cost different amount of fate points.

    Purchasing of abilities can be limited to 1 per week (normally).

    Players might have an ability to learn abilities of the heroes from
    the same fraction.

    Players might also learn abilities for their army, and specialties
    can just increase the effect of these abilities.

    For instance, Fort can learn +25% Fire Resistance for some unit type.

    Castle can learn Defence aura on Pikemen that scales up with Pikemen in
    the group, but basic block value is limited to 20. It increases with
    Combat Tactics with +10 to block cap per level of Combat Tactics
    (+15 for Halberdier). In case of some units, they can gain increased bonuses
    if spells are applied to them.

  Veasin: Adjust poison abilities, maybe could be Poisoned Weapons or Weakening,
    that makes enemy take additional damage each time he is attacked.
