    Add: item which grants move speed to random unit group at the beginnnig
      of the fight. This would help with making the first move.

    Add: item which allows to cast Enchant-like spell, so casters can increase
      their damage output within the same round.
    
    Add: item which allows to instantly cast Enchant agains all enemies.

    Idea: Dueling. Dueling can reduce enemy's damage when he is attacking other than
