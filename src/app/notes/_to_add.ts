/* 
    Short ideas of things to add

    Add: item which grants move speed to random unit group at the beginnnig
      of the fight. This would help with making the first move.

    Add: item which allows to cast Enchant-like spell, so casters can increase
      their damage output within the same round.
    
    Add: item which allows to instantly cast Enchant agains all enemies.

    Idea: Dueling. Dueling can reduce enemy's damage when he is attacking other than
      someone he's dueling now.

    Idea: There could be some ways to not only learn abilities, but also masteries
      at the same time. For example, visiting Witch Hut can grant a hero both 
      Enchant and some Mastery, that allows to cast is instantly against all enemies.

      And it also could be the only way to achieve this Mastery, would be no other ways,
      only Witch Hut.
