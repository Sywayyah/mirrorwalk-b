/*
  Ideas for locations:

    Assaulted Villages. Rewards (all/random/combined): increased maximum growth for unit type,
    army joiners, increase hiring reserve (reserve might be hired from Tavern).
*/

/**
 * New types of locations: Those that block going further unless you spend some resources.
 *  For instance, there migth be a loc-cluster, where you can hire undead units and buy items
 *  for them to be accessed, however, you need to go through location that costs you valuable resources/mana.
 *
 * There might also be some hiring resource. When building a tavern, it might give you 1 hiring point.
 *  Hiring points could unlock hiring on some locations, etc.
