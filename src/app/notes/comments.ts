    For having doomstring. What can be better? On the one hand,
        I do want to have this item. But also, how should it work?
        Should all ranged units use its effects, or maybe you
        throw a buff to a unit group. Or is it the weapon of your
        hero, in this case hero should deal damage as well.

        Maybe.. maybe this even needs to be a special costly unit
        type, who is hard to split.

    What should be units orientation... vertical or horizontal..
        From the inside, I feel like I want to see horizontal one.
        Also a good question, what kind of panels there will be
        during the fight.

    Sustaining an army. The interesting question. Is it possible for
        a player to lose before the end? It it likely that yes.
        In this case, hero and his army may become ghosts,
        enabling some disadvantages and advantages.

        On the other hand, there is more to it. How do player
        sustain army? Maybe there can be couple ways.

        Hero might have an ability to heal groups after or during
        the fight.

        There can be.. something similar to first aid tent in Homm 3
        when it's like can heal random unit group when it has its
        turn, and upgraded version can allow to choose target
        (it seems like there is similar thing in homm as well).

        Lifesteal/Lifetap kind of thing probably

    Also, there can be some good items that players may want to
        have early. For example, some item that increases
        speed of all groups (or up to certain level), meaning
        that most common and least dangerous neutral groups
        will have to attack second, dealing reduced damage,
        or dealing no damage at all.

    Resources. I do want to have crystals. Crystals will be
        something rare, and what enables you in the most cases
        to buy higher level creatures. I would also love to have
        gems, for some reason.


    Also, experience and glory. So far, I was thinking about
        glory as about the way of getting advanced units,
        items and other services. In homm there is no such thing as
        glory though

    Uprading system. I was having an idea of unit type upgrades. Unit type
        can have couple of branches for upgrade. Also, it can be so that
        type will be upgraded into higher levels than initial.
        (lvl.2 Archers -> lvl.4 Crossbowmen or lvl.5 Elite Archers or
        something). I'm not sure about if each faction has to have
        1-7 levels, or strictly 7 unit types, will see.

        This will also introduce more gameplay styles (for different races
        as well). It will also allow early game creatures to remain
        relevant at later stages (though, cost of the upgrade may be
        high at some conditions).

        Some other base unit types, on the other hand, could be risky.
        Bases can be not so strong, but upgrades can be great.
        Risk-reward kind of thing..
