    Here are just some mechanics. Some may be used, some are just described, 
        some can be potential.


    (Potential) Crests. Crest is a special item. Crest may give a player some
        helpful abilities, for example:
        
        Rangers Guild Crest: you start each round with 8 Rangers;
        
        Arcane Crest: Allows to use basic spells with cooldown of 1 enemy turn;

        Portents Crest: Allows to use basic curses with cooldown of 1 enemy turn;

        Ice Crest: Reduces all enemy groups move speed by 3;

        Crests can be sold and bought in town structures or neutral ones. It could be
        that player can have more than one crest, but some of them may not stack.
    
    (Used) Heroes may start with certain items. This can make some interesting heroes.
    
    (Planned) Heroes, on level up, can upgrade Spells or Specialties. There are some spells
        which are developed well, and some of them also heavily rely on Masteries.

        For example, Rain of Fire, when leveled, can target additional random enemy group,
        and Meteor, with a certain Mastery, can land instantly, instead of waiting one turn.

        Also.. can it be that there are some special properties in spells coming with
        next levels (or not coming, some are unobtainable from leveling spells),
        and some Masteries can just speed up this process? For example, on the level 4,
        Rain of Fire adds one more random target, and what if there would be a Mastery which
        allows to have this effect earlier?

    (Potential) Additional spell casting. May it be that some unit types would allow hero
        to cast spells once again during the same round? It could be an ability with global
        cooldown, and may cost some mana to refresh hero's abilities.

    (Potential) If will be strongly restricted to have more than one cast per round, maybe
        some items can be added? For instance, some item that can allows to cast 
        level 3 Enchant on the enemy. Or some advanced item with an ability Eclipse,
        which instantly places level 4 Enchant on all enemy unit groups.

    (Potential) Persistent Debuffs, which are not getting dispelled by the end of the fight.
        Could add some additional difficulty and introduce dangerous creatures/bosses. Also
        can possibly be cured in special locations or towns.
