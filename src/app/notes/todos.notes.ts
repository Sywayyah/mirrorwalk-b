  Todo: Add 'Defend' action. Unit skips his turn and gains some bonus defence till the end of
  the round

    UG card.
        - for now, UG card info is a little messy, damage is wrong most likely,
            no info about bonus stats and no info about armor/attack.

*/
/*
  maybe add some manipulations with queue, some units might exchange speed with other,
  some might discard their turn to grant something to someone else,
  some units might discard their turn to give 2 turns to some other unit type

  Also, maybe, if unit skips turn, it will give you action point, so this
  action point can be spent on something else.

  Some unit groups might not be able to attack same group twice.

  Unit skips turn in this round -> Hero gains point -> Player uses it to cast additional ability

  Some spells might immediately end current round.
*/

/*
  Meteor: Deals damage, next 2 units in fight queue will skip their turns

  Charged Strike: makes current unit group attack with charged strike, dealing additional
    damage. When Current unit is of cavalry type, deals 50% more damage and critical strike

  Spell Points: Player cannot cast when he has no spell points left. His hero, however,
    might possess Red Spell Points. These Spell points will allow you to cast more spells,
    but manacost is going to be doubled.

    Might also create Yellow Spell Points, abilities of attacking type might require them,
    and have increased manacost when consuming other points.

  Ice Arrow: when cast with current unit group === ranged, gains +1 damage per unit. Might consume a turn
    of the current unit group.

  Potential Spells System Rework: Spells might exist in 5 tiers. Hero might give level to
    entire tier (or all fire spells in that tier, for instance). Maybe some mechanics to relearn
    abilities.
