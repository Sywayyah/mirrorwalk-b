/*
  Game objects will have an id, it will be possible for me to keep track of
    existing objects. Also, objects can be easily enhanced, with
    things like cleanups, methods, events, etc.

  So, this allows objects to be tracked. Second thing, I could use
    my event system here, these GameObjects might listen to it and emit events
    on their own. Third thing is that theoretically, events can be targeted at
    specific entity.

  Current Game Objects:

  UnitGroup, Item, Hero, Player, Spell, Structure
