  be easier to implement while giving more opportunities, making game more interesting
  and filling missing parts. While also providing aestetics of the card game.

  The game might include board game elements.

      players are making conscious decisions about each other
        1.1 Players can easily play on the same machine, or remotely
        1.2 Easier to implement AI
        1.3 Potential for teams, or multiple heroes per player

      2. Element of randomness: throw of dice will open some opportunities.
        2.1 Digital dice mode and real dice throw mode
        2.2 Events, traveling, etc.

      3. New mechanics that could affect board part of the game.
        3.1 Examples:
          Philosophy: increases experience gained by hero.
          Superluminal: Allows to avoid forced battles, countered if opponent has
            same card and uses it (excluding final battle).

      4. There could be easier map generation, meaning more variety.
