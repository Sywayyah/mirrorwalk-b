    # Artifacts, their active and passive abilities:
    
    What if, for example:

        Doomstring: your ranged units gain ability to apply Amplified Damage debuff against the target,
            reducing their physical damage resistance by -50%.

    
    Like, when it's turn for a unit group, basing on it's damage type, it can use some of the type-based abilities.
    Maybe also can be some kind of... level requirements. For example, Doomstring can only be used by archers level 4.
    
    I like this idea with requirements. Can make some player to prioritize to have some specific units in his army,
        since if player has no ranged units or ranged units with not enough level cannot use this strong item.

    
    # What if.. neutral groups can also have items (with active abilities)

    And there can be an item as reward.
    
    # UI

    What if.. long cards?
