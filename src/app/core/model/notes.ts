    My game

        I want to have ghosts, probably as basic neutral enemies. They may protect the location of crypt.
         Once guard is defeated, a player can hire basic ghosts from the crypt.
         They can only be upgraded at the city of this kind.

        Units can be sold as well.

        Cities may have many buildings. Upgrading them will allow player to hire and upgrade more units.

        Also i feel like there can be done two things, the building can be upgraded with a camp,
         so next time this city won't have upgrade, or can be upgraded completely so it will be always available.

        Also. There could be an item which ensures that you'll have this kind of town in the next round, for a certain price.

        Also. The amount of active groups might be limited, and some talents may increase this allowed group quantity.

        Also. Locations at the start.
        Resources. Mines. Artifact. Library. Hirelings.

        A player may have 3-4 different locations and it will be up to him what he wants, resources, army,
         spells, items, or income. And his amount of turns per location is limited.

        And sometimes it will be open for a player which resource or item he is going to get.

        Later more, like, foreseeing tower, etc.

        And experience or glory will unlock more buildings

        ==== 
        
        Might also be interesting.
            Aside from these, there might be random thing locations. There might be random reward of given type and guard.
            The thing is that random locations might have slightly bigger enemies, but also slightly better rewards.

    # Artifacts, their active and passive abilities:
    
    What if, for example:

        Doomstring: your ranged units gain ability to apply Amplified Damage debuff against the target,
            reducing their physical damage resistance by -50%.

    
    Like, when it's turn for a unit group, basing on it's damage type, it can use some of the type-based abilities.
    Maybe also can be some kind of... level requirements. For example, Doomstring can only be used by archers level 4.
    
    I like this idea with requirements. Can make some player to prioritize to have some specific units in his army,
        since if player has no ranged units or ranged units with not enough level cannot use this strong item.

    
    # What if.. neutral groups can also have items (with active abilities)

    And there can be an item as reward.
    
    # UI

    What if.. long cards?
